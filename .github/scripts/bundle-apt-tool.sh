# Bundle an apt-installed package's binaries into the cli-tools sysext tree,
# made self-contained so it runs on TrueNAS without installing anything there.
#
# Strategy (the "private-lib + rpath" pattern):
#   * Copy every ELF executable the package ships under {,/usr}/{bin,sbin}
#     into the sysext, normalizing /bin -> /usr/bin and /sbin -> /usr/sbin
#     (systemd-sysext only merges /usr, so binaries must live there).
#   * For each binary, walk its shared-library closure (ldd) and copy every
#     non-glibc library into a PRIVATE dir, /usr/lib/prometheus-exporters/lib, then set
#     an rpath so the binary loads those copies instead of (possibly missing
#     or mismatched) host libraries. We deliberately do NOT bundle the glibc
#     core or the dynamic loader -- those are resolved from the host, which
#     is why the build runs on the oldest supported Debian base (forward-
#     compatible glibc).
#   * rpath is set on the binary ($ORIGIN/../lib/prometheus-exporters/lib) AND on each
#     bundled library ($ORIGIN) so transitive deps resolve regardless of
#     whether the loader honors DT_RPATH or DT_RUNPATH semantics.
#   * Copy package-owned data under /usr/share (minus docs/man/locale) so
#     tools with runtime data files (e.g. nmap's nmap-services) work.
#
# Usage: bundle-apt-tool.sh <sysext_root> <package> <manifest_file>
# Must run on a Debian system matching the target (the package must already
# be apt-installed). Appends realized command names to <manifest_file>.
